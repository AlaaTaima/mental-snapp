### Summary :pencil:
Mental Snapp is a mobile-first web application which allows people in general and women in particular to write down about their feelings or life through answering a set of questions.

### Challenge :warning:
Users need a way to connect to their feelings so that they can accept themselves and feel confident that they can manage their lives.

### Solution :bulb: 
Mental Snapp supports users in developing an active self awareness so that they can reframe negative moods into positive ones and as a result they can move from victims to someones who are in control.
