### Project Description :book: 
People are having issues controlling their feelings and keeping up with their lives. In **Mental Snapp** we've created a routine for those people that involves self-reflection and journalling, we believe that by making our users write down about their feelings or life then they will feel better :100: about themselves, our main goal is helping people in **maintaining positive mental health** outcomes.
### Problem Statement :exclamation:
The user needs a way to connect to her feelings so that she can accept herself and feel confident that she can manage her life.

### Solution :bulb: 
Creating a framework that supports users in developing an active self awareness so that they can reframe negative moods into positive ones and as a result they can move from victims to someones who are in control.
