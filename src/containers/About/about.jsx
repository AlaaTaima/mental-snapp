          Welcome to Mental Snapp. Because good mental health is an art built on
          the habit of catching and appreciating ordinary moments. Journalling
          is a way to do just that - tell your story and guide your thoughts to
          a positive and honest frame of mind.

        <p className="about__content">
          Our journalling technique is based on a system that has been practiced
          by monks since the Middle Ages, the Daily Examen. Itâ€™s based on three
          questions: What am I grateful for? Recognising good things. A chance
          to be thankful. What challenges do I face? Acknowledging - not denying
          - daily challenges. What am I developing? Noting the character
          strengths and new skills that can come out of current circumstances.

          These three questions, answered regularly, are more than the sum of
          their parts. They add up to a journalling practice that will help
          clarity, confidence and self compassion.
