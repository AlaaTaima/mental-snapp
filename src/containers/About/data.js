      'Our journalling technique is based on a system that has been practiced by monks since the Middle Ages, the Daily Examen. Itâ€™s based on three questions: What am I grateful for? Recognising good things. A chance to be thankful. What challenges do I face? Acknowledging - not denying- daily challenges. What am I developing? Noting the character strengths and new skills that can come out of current circumstances.',
